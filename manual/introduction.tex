This manual describes \smtrat, a \Cpp library consisting of a collection of
SMT-compliant implementations of methods for solving non-linear real
arithmetic (NRA) formulas, we refer to as modules. These modules can be 
combined to (1) a theory solver in order to extend the supported logics of an
existing SMT solver by NRA or (2) an SMT solver for NRA. The latter is 
especially intended to be a testing environment for the development 
of SMT-compliant implementations of further methods tackling NRA.
\smtrat provides a graphical user interface for the creation of such
module combinations according to a strategy. It decides dynamically
which modules solve a given NRA formula, involving the formula's
properties and the solving history.
