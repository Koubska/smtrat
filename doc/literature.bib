	abstract="Polynomial constraint solving plays a prominent role in several areas of hardware and software analysis and verification, e.g., termination proving, program invariant generation and hybrid system verification, to name a few. In this paper we propose a new method for solving non-linear constraints based on encoding the problem into an SMT problem considering only linear arithmetic. Unlike other existing methods, our method focuses on proving satisfiability of the constraints rather than on proving unsatisfiability, which is more relevant in several applications as we illustrate with several examples. Nevertheless, we also present new techniques based on the analysis of unsatisfiable cores that allow one to efficiently prove unsatisfiability too for a broad class of problems. The power of our approach is demonstrated by means of extensive experiments comparing our prototype with state-of-the-art tools on benchmarks taken both from the academic and the industrial world.",

abstract="We present two tests that solve linear integer arithmetic constraints. These tests are sound and efficiently find solutions for a large number of problems. While many complete methods search along the problem surface for a solution, these tests use cubes to explore the interior of the problems. The tests are especially efficient for constraints with a large number of integer solutions, e.g., those with infinite lattice width. Inside the SMT-LIB benchmarks, we have found almost one thousand problem instances with infinite lattice width, and we have shown the advantage of our cube tests on these instances by comparing our implementation of the cube test with several state-of-the-art SMT solvers. Our implementation is not only several orders of magnitudes faster, but it also solves all instances, which most SMT solvers do not. Finally, we discovered an additional application for our cube tests: the extraction of equalities implied by a system of linear arithmetic inequalities. This extraction is useful both as a preprocessing step for linear integer constraint solving as well as for the combination of theories by the Nelson-Oppen method.",

abstract = "Congruence closure algorithms for deduction in ground equational theories are ubiquitous in many (semi-)decision procedures used for verification and automated deduction. In many of these applications one needs an incremental algorithm that is moreover capable of recovering, among the thousands of input equations, the small subset that explains the equivalence of a given pair of terms. In this paper we present an algorithm satisfying all these requirements. First, building on ideas from abstract congruence closure algorithms, we present a very simple and clean incremental congruence closure algorithm and show that it runs in the best known time O(n log n). After that, we introduce a proof-producing union-find data structure that is then used for extending our congruence closure algorithm, without increasing the overall O(n log n) time, in order to produce a k-step explanation for a given equation in almost optimal time (quasi-linear in k). Finally, we show that the previous algorithms can be smoothly extended, while still obtaining the same asymptotic time bounds, in order to support the interpreted functions symbols successor and predecessor, which have been shown to be very useful in applications such as microprocessor verification."

In our work we use this method for satisfiability checking in satisfiability modulo theories solver technologies, and tune it by trying to avoid some computation steps that are needed for quantifier elimination but not for satisfiability checking. We further propose novel data structures and adapt the method to work incrementally and to support backtracking. We verify the effectiveness experimentally by comparing different versions of the cylindrical algebraic decomposition used within a state-of-the-art satisfiability modulo theories solver."

The transcendental functions are represented as uninterpreted in the abstract space, which is described in terms of the combined theory of linear arithmetic on the rationals with uninterpreted functions, and are incrementally axiomatized by means of upper- and lower-bounding piecewise-linear functions. Suitable numerical techniques are used to ensure that the abstractions of the transcendental functions are sound even in presence of irrationals.
