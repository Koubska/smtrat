This manual describes \smtrat, a toolbox which is specifically tailored to be
used by an SMT solver in order to solve non-linear real arithmetic
(NRA) efficiently.  NRA is an important but hard-to-solve theory and
only a fragment of it can be handled by some of the currently existing
SMT solvers.  The toolbox consists of four modules, implementing the
virtual substitution method, the cylindrical algebraic decomposition
method, a groebner bases simplifier and a general simplifier,
respectively. The intention of the toolbox is that an SMT-compliant
theory solver can be achieved by composing these modules according to
a user defined strategy and with the goal to exploit their advantages.
Furthermore, it supports the addition of further modules implementing
other methods dealing with real arithmetic.
