\section{Requirements}
\smtrat has been successfully compiled and tested under Linux. For its configuration we use \cmake, which can be found on \cmakeURL, and for its compilation we use \gplusplus (version 4.7 or higher), available on \gplusplusURL. The configuration settings can be changed with the command line interface \ccmake. The arithmetic calculations within \smtrat use the \Cpp library \Ginac, which can be found on \ginacURL. The algebraic operations and data structures within \smtrat are based on the \Cpp library \ginacra available at \ginacraURL. Optional, there is a grapical user interface for the composition of a solver, which needs \java (version 1.7 or higher). Note, that we use \Cppeleven. Summarizing, you need the following packages before installation:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \gplusplus (version 4.7 or higher)
	\item \cmake
	\item \ccmake
	\item \Ginac
	\item \ginacra
	\item \java (version 1.7 or higher)
\end{itemize}

\section{Building, installing and uninstalling \smtrat}
