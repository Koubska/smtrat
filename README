Project name: SMT-RAT - Satisfiability-Modulo-Theories Real Algebra Toolbox
Contact: Florian Corzilius <corzilius@cs.rwth-aachen.de>, Ulrich Loup <loup@cs.rwth-aachen.de>
Project sourceforge page: http://smtrat.sourceforge.net/
Development status: beta

* Prerequisites
	- A C++ Compiler with c++0x capabilities. We assume GCC 4.5 or higher.
    - The build system CMake (only for building the library): http://www.cmake.org/
    - The library CLN: http://www.ginac.de/CLN/
    - The library GiNaC: http://www.ginac.de/

* Optional dependencies
    - The library GiNaCRA: http://ginacra.sourceforge.net/ (CAD module, GB module)
	- Blas and Lapack libraries e.g. http://www.netlib.org/blas/, http://www.netlib.org/lapack/  (NSS extension for GB)
    - The documentation build system Doxygen: http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/ 
    - The build system Ant (only for building the gui): http://ant.apache.org/
    - A Java development environment >= 1.6 (only for building the gui): http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index.html

* Run the solver
The solver can be found in the build directory. It is usually called smtratSolver. It accepts .smt2 files as described by the smtlib (http://www.smtlib.org/).
For more information, run './smtratSolver --help'. To run the solver on an inputfile 'input.smt2' run './smtratSolver input.smt2'.


* How to build the project including library and the binary (solver)
mkdir build         // Create a separate build directory.
cd build
cmake ..            // Configure using cmake. Use "ccmake .." in order for an interactive user interface with more options.
make                // Build the project, in particular, build the solver smtratSolver

* Other targets to make

make help           // Show a list of possible targets.
make clean          // Force the build system to re-build everything.
make install        // Install library to the specified (adjust via ccmake) system directory.
make gui            // Make the java-based GUI.
make run-gui        // Make/run the java-based GUI.
make package        // Construct a package of the project.
make doc            // Build the project API documentation.


* How to build the API documentation

Required: Doxygen: http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/

make doc

* Note on how to include a new module
  We included a little python script called writeModules.py. Run it with the name of the module as argument. 
  It will create an empty but working script for you. 
  You might have to lookup the cmake option SMTRAT_ENABLE_"modulename" to include it in the compilestack.

* Troubleshooting
  - I have GiNaCRA installed but SMT-RAT does not find it!
	You can set the right path manually by cmake .. -i and use the advanced options. We recommend using the command line interface tool ccmake for this.

  This list can grow - by your help! Just contact one of the authors.
