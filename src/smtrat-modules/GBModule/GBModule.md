# GBModule {#GBModule}

Implements the Gr√∂bner bases based procedure as presented in @cite Junges2013. In general, this procedure can detect only the unsatisfiability of a conjunction of equations. This module also supports the usage of these equations to further simplify all constraints in the conjunction of constraints forming its input and passes these simplified constraints to its backends. However, it cannot be guaranteed that backends perform better on the simplified constraints than on the constraints before simplification.

### Efficiency
The worst case complexity of the underlying procedure is exponential in the number of variables of the input constraints. In the case that the conjunction of constraints to check for satisfiability contains equations, this module can be more efficient than other modules for NRA on finding out inconsistency.
