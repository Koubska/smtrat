\title{SMT-RAT 2.0}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

SMT-RAT is an open-source C++ toolbox for strategic and parallel SMT solving
consisting of a collection of SMT compliant implementations of methods for
solving quantifier-free (non)linear real and integer arithmetic as well as
the logics of bitvectors and uninterpreted functions.


The focus of SMT-RAT is nonlinear arithmetic.
% todo: florian

Our current implementation for the logic of uninterpreted functions is the
result of a practical course within the winter term 2014/2015. The theory
solver as well as the preprocessing techniques for this logic have been
implemented and optimized solely by four master students that are listed
below.

To broaden the scope of SMT-RAT and demonstrate its expandability to other
logics, we offered a master thesis to implement a decision procedure for
bitvector logic. Our current implementation for this logic was solely
written by the master student listed below.
